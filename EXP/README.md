# Goal

Use Hot Starts code to modify the starting distribution of the environment. In theory, this will enable the agent to focus its experience collection towards novel parts of the environment.

# Dependencies

- Lightweight one step transition dynamic models
- Curiosity formulation (variance of one-step models?)
- HotStarts wrapper code
- Some environment suited to display progress towards goal
